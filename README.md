## 1. Prelude
	Welcome to our project "SNAKEIFFEL" ! The project consists of our own interpretation of the well known and often copied game "SNAKE".
	The player controls the snake on by changing directions on the playfield.
	The goal of the game lies in collecting as much points by eating Appels without letting the snake eat his own Tail.
	The game doesn't need to have an internet connection and can be played alone.
	It is a great idea to spend some fun time and to sharpen your reflexes.

### Goal
	The aim is to combine the skills and competencies learned in programming and software engineering within a single project.
	To help us plan and advance we will use SCRUM.
	We are planning to go through two sprints for this project.

### Conditions
	- The game should be programmed with JAVA
	- The project should be published on GitHub.
	- The build automation should be done with MAVEN.
	- This program should be playable on MAC, Windows and Linux Computers.
	- The classes of the program should have the appropriate Unit-Tests.
	- The program should be able to be executed using a specially created JAR file and the command java-jar xxxxx.jar.
