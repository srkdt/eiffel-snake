## Prelude
Welcome to our project "SNAKEIFFEL" ! The project consists of our own interpretation of the well known and often copied game "SNAKE".
The player controls the snake on by changing directions on the playfield.
The goal of the game lies in collecting points by eating Apples, without letting the snake eat his own Tail.
The game doesn't need an internet connection and can be played alone.
It is a great idea to spend some fun time and to sharpen your reflexes.

### Goal
The aim is to combine the skills and competencies learned in programming and software engineering within a single project.
For development we're using the SCRUM framework.
We are planning on two sprints for this project.

### Conditions
* The game should be programmed with JAVA
* The project should be published on GitHub.
* The build automation should be done with MAVEN.
* This program should be playable on MAC, Windows and Linux Computers.
* The classes of the program should have the appropriate Unit-Tests.
* The program should be able to be executed using a specially created JAR file and the command java-jar xxxxx.jar.

## Build instructions
* Laden Sie die Datei .jar auf ihren Computer runter.
* Vergewissern Sie sich, dass Sie eine Java Runtime Environment auf Ihrem Computer installiert haben.
* Klicken Sie (Doppelklick) auf ebenjene, um die Datei auszuführen.

## Operating manual
Here is a short introduction to our game: 
* After starting the game, a start interface will appear with different buttons: START, EXIT....
* The goal is to eat as many apples as possible to make the snake grow  
* Each apple eaten gives 20 points 
* When you bump into yourself you will die 
* You can return to the menu or exit the game at any time
